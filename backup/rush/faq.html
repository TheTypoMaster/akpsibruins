<strong>Curious about rush? Well, here are some of the most common questions answered.</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Why should I join Alpha Kappa Psi?</em><br />
Alpha Kappa Psi offers unique professional, social and service opportunities that complement your academic career here at UCLA. Our fraternity is made up of a diversity of people who have a common desire for excellence in all areas of life. As such, each of us believes in a rich and fulfilling college career and that being a part of Alpha Kappa Psi has helped us in many ways to achieve that. In our fraternity, brotherhood and professionalism go hand in hand as we provide a supportive environment that allows each of us to grow individually, and together as brothers. If you are looking to make the most of yourself and your college experience, we encourage you to find out more about our program.<br />
<br />
<em>Why did you join Alpha Kappa Psi?</em><br />
As you may find out throughout rush, each of our brothers had a different reason for coming out and deciding to pledge Alpha Kappa Psi. Alpha Kappa Psi prides itself in being able to offer numerous quality programs and resources to its members and thus, there is really no "correct reason" for joining Alpha Kappa Psi. Whether it is our exciting brotherhood events that help build lifelong friendships or the professional resources that give you that extra step towards success in your post undergraduate years, we offer something for every single one of our brothers. We strive to make our college years some of the most memorable and productive times of our lives.<br />
<br />
<em>Does Alpha Kappa Psi only take Business majors?</em><br />
No, although most members are pursuing Business related majors, Alpha Kappa Psi accepts all majors. We believe that a keen sense of business is important in all fields. Our members come from diverse backgrounds, and include engineers passionate about entrepreneurship, Psychology majors striving to become lawyers, pre-meds that are working their way towards medical school, or Sociology majors looking to join the Non-Profit world to enact positive social change. The uniting quality among all members is an appetite for professional success, regardless of industry.<br />
<br />
<em>How much of a time commitment is Alpha Kappa Psi?</em><br />
Much like anything you do in life, it depends on how much you want to get out of Alpha Kappa Psi. Alpha Kappa Psi provides opportunities and resources to grow as a professional, a leader and a brother. Those that gain the most out of these opportunities and resources often put in a lot of heart and dedication. This may seem like a lot but if you compare it to anything you have ever done in life and were passionate about, you will find the similarities.
<br />
What about my grades? Will being in Alpha Kappa Psi hinder my academic progress and success?<br />
It is often perceived that joining a Greek organization in general implies bad grades and massive partying. However, as students of UCLA especially, we came into the university with academics as our top priority, and being in Alpha Kappa Psi has not changed that. We work hard academically but also strive to be well rounded individuals through organizations such as Alpha Kappa Psi. Participating in Alpha Kappa Psi has only made us more efficient in achieving each of our long term goals. Our alumni have had much success in their post undergraduate years studying at top professional schools, working at Fortune 500 companies and even in building their own companies.<br />
<br />
<em>Does Alpha Kappa Psi offer...?</em><br />
We offer many programs and events that cater to different needs and thus, strongly believe that we offer something for everyone. However, if there is something that one of our brothers want that we do not already offer, brotherhood and professionalism go hand in hand in creating a positive environment for new ideas and programs to develop. In fact, as a brother, you may find yourself leading that new idea which not only benefits everyone else but your own professional development as well.<br />
<br />
<em>I've heard that Alpha Kappa Psi is...</em><br />
As an intelligent individual, we encourage you to find out about more about us through rush and make your own decisions. After all, it ultimately is you who will decide whether our fraternity is what you are looking for.<br />
